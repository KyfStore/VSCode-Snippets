# Welcome To VSCode Snippets+

## Introduction

VSCode Snippets+ can help you run short/long snippets that you repeatedly use, such as a simple code runner to execute your code!

## Create Snippet

When you first start this extension, you may notice a new option on your left sidebar called "Snippets." This is where you can create, delete, and run all your snippets! To create a snippet:

1. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + P`.
2. Search for `VSCode Snippets+ | Create Snippet` and select it.
3. Choose the language for your snippet.
4. Enter a name for your snippet.
5. The snippet will open in a new file tab where you can write your code. 

To view all your snippets, just click on the "Snippets" tab in the sidebar.

## Delete Snippet

To delete a snippet press `CTRL + SHIFT + P` and search for `VSCode Snippets+ | Delete Snippet`. Select the snippet you want to delete and confirm the deletion in the notification.

After confirming, your snippet will be deleted.

## Run Snippet

To run a snippet:

1. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + P` and search for `VSCode Snippets+ | Build/Run Snippet`.
2. Select the snippet you wish to run.
3. The snippet will execute in a new Snippet Terminal. 
4. Some Snippets will open an external file such as the HTML snippet file type.

**Note:** You may need to install certain programs to run specific file types, such as [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for `.py` files or [Java](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) for `.java` files. Some files, like HTML Files (.html), Batch files (.bat), Bash files (.sh), or CMD files (.cmd), do not require additional programs.
